```
cd build
cmake .. -Dtests=ON
make -j test
```

More verbose output can be found by running `ctest`:
```
ctest --verbose
```

## Documentation
Code docuemntation can be genreated with doxygen.
```

One can include the tests as well by using `Doxyfile_wTests`. The output is
generated in `doc/html`.
